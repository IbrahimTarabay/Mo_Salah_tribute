      <li><strong>2010</strong> - Salah started his senior career with hometown club El Mokawloon in the Egyptian Premier League in 2010, departing shortly thereafter to join Basel for an undisclosed fee</li>

      <li><strong>2014</strong> - Salah's performances then attracted Premier League side Chelsea, and subsequently signed for the team for a £11 million fee in 2014. However, he was used sparingly in his debut season, and was allowed to leave on loan to Serie A clubs Fiorentina</li>
      <li><strong>2014</strong> - Salah scored his first goal for Chelsea against Arsenal at Stamford Bridge in the London Derby</li>
      <li><strong>2014</strong> - Before the 2014–15 season, Salah's future with Chelsea looked to be in a balance after reports suggested he could be forced to return to Egypt to carry out military service after his registration for an education scheme was rescinded by the Egyptian Minister of Higher Education</li>
      <li><strong>2014</strong> - Salah changed squad numbers from 15 to 17 for the start of the season, with his new number having been vacated by Eden Hazard changing to number 10</li>

      <li><strong>2015</strong> -  Fiorentina reportedly activated an option to make the loan move permanent, but Salah refused the move. Even though the loan agreement was for 18 months, Salah refused to return to Fiorentina and instead joined fellow Serie A club Roma</li>
